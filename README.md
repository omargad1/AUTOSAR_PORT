# Porting AUTOSAR Port Driver on Tiva C

This guide provides a step-by-step description of porting an AUTOSAR-compliant Port Driver onto the Tiva C microcontroller platform. The Port Driver is responsible for abstracting and controlling the microcontroller's General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) ports in compliance with the AUTOSAR standard.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the porting process, ensure you have the following:

- **Tiva C Series Microcontroller**: Specifically, the TM4C123GH6PM model is used for this guide.
- **Development Environment**: Texas Instruments' Code Composer Studio (CCS) or any other compatible IDE.
- **AUTOSAR Port Driver Specification**: To understand the standard requirements and interfaces.
- **TivaWare Software**: Texas Instruments' peripheral driver library for Tiva C.
- **Basic Knowledge of AUTOSAR**: Understanding of the AUTOSAR architecture and the role of the Port Driver.

## Steps for Porting

### 1. Setup Development Environment

1. **Install Code Composer Studio (CCS)**: Ensure CCS is installed and configured for Tiva C.
2. **Download and Install TivaWare**: Obtain the TivaWare software package and extract it to your working directory.

### 2. Create Project in CCS

1. **Start a New Project**: Open CCS and create a new project for the TM4C123GH6PM.
2. **Configure the Target**: Set the correct microcontroller model and other relevant settings.

### 3. Implement AUTOSAR Port Driver Interface

1. **Understand AUTOSAR Port Driver Requirements**: Refer to the AUTOSAR specification for Port Driver (AUTOSAR_SWS_PortDriver).
2. **Define Port Driver API**: Implement the required functions such as `Port_Init`, `Port_SetPinDirection`, `Port_RefreshPortDirection`, `Port_GetVersionInfo`, and `Port_SetPinMode`.
